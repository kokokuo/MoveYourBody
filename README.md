# Motion Sensing Game with Kinect Sensor - Move Your Body

# Summary
“Motion Sensing Game with Kinect Sensor - Move Your Body” is my one-year Graduation Project of University. Adopt the Kinect sensor that just launched at that time to develop the 3D Game.

For motion sensing, because the KinectSDK hadn’t released from Microsoft, we used the OpeNI/NITE which made from Kinect producer company called PrimeSight to receive Kinect image and depth source.

Then analyzed it using Image Processing/Computer Vision, designed and developed gesture detection algorithm. At the Same time, designed the Game Content, developed Game with OOP and Design Pattern and XNA 4.0 Game Framework to built it up.
